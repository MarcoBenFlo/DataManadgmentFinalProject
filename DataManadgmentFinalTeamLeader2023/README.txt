**Description:**
 This software is designed to collect information from a CSV file, process the data, 
 and provide tools to plot graphs and print polynomials using Python.

**Dependencies:**
 Make sure you have Python installed. You can install the necessary libraries by running 'pip' in Command Prompt:
 * matplotlib.pyplot
 * numpy
 * load_data
 * sort

**Installation:**
 After downloading the zip folder, open files and double click on the folder. There is an option
 to extract all files from the zip folder. Doing so will allow Python to use the templates.

**Usage:**
 To begin using the UI program for Module 1, you need to capitalize a letter and add ')' after it,
 that will prompt the interface to display the commands available for you to pick from. 

To begin using the UI program for Module 2, same commands as Module 1 are used. 
 So you will write the capitalize letter paired with the command you want it to call, 
 followed by the file you want it to go through, subsequently what you want it to filter 
 and sorts accordingly. In simple terms, it is like a to-do list.
